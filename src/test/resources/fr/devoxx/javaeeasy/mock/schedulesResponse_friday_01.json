        "summary": "The recent unveiling of Android Wear introduced a brand new set of challenges and opportunities for application designers and developers. Indeed, wearable computing requires designers to think in a radically different manner while offering tremendous new ways to improve people lives. This session acts as a complete overview of the new Android Wear ecosystem and explains how developers can push their existing apps to the wearable level from both a designer and a developer perspective."
