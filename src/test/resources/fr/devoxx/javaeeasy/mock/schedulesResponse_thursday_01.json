Many people know that OpenJDK is the open source reference implementation for the JDK, but how many of us take the time to explore the inner-workings of the platform that we build our applications upon? We believe that every developer can learn something by doing so.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to explore the source code and perhaps see how lambdas have been implemented in JDK 8, or hack on the JDK itself and learn how to make that modification to HashMap that you’ve always dreamed of, or even learn how you can help to make it easier for fellow developers to contribute code to upstream Oracle repos, then we’ve got you covered. Come and join us for an evening of OpenJDK exploration, and learn how you can explore and contribute to the future of Java in a very practical fashion."},"fromTime":"19:00","toTimeMillis":1415905200000,"toTime":"20:00","roomCapacity":70,"roomName":"BOF 2","slotId":"bof_bof2_thursday_13_19h0_20h0","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room8","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1415901600000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"talkType":"Keynote","track":"Methodology & DevOps","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Keynote on Infinite Possibilities on all IT aspects.</p>\n","id":"YVU-7155","speakers":[{"link":{"href":"http://cfp.devoxx.fr/api/conferences/DevoxxFR2015/speakers/fa9be1fb8b75625776caef0a4946a16dc690e505","rel":"http://cfp.devoxx.fr/api/profile/speaker","title":"Denise Jacobs"},"name":"Denise Jacobs"}],"title":"Infinite Possibilities","lang":"en","summary":"Keynote on Infinite Possibilities on all IT aspects."},"fromTime":"19:00","toTimeMillis":1415903400000,"toTime":"19:30","roomCapacity":745,"roomName":"Room 8","slotId":"key_room8_thursday_13_19h0_19h30","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"bof1","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1415905200000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"classroom","talk":{"talkType":"BOF (Bird of a Feather)","track":"Java SE","summaryAsHtml":"<p>This BOF is a great excuse to meet face 2 face with all the other User Group leaders and enjoy a few beers afterwards  :)</p>\n","id":"GDE-5639","speakers":[{"link":{"href":"http://cfp.devoxx.fr/api/conferences/DevoxxFR2015/speakers/4b92b9fcc31eae2b6236147b1db6a30609b43e33","rel":"http://cfp.devoxx.fr/api/profile/speaker","title":"Stephan Janssen"},"name":"Stephan Janssen"},{"link":{"href":"http://cfp.devoxx.fr/api/conferences/DevoxxFR2015/speakers/9f17f819d202fd15d48aaad29ed288da86ed62b6","rel":"http://cfp.devoxx.fr/api/profile/speaker","title":"Martijn Verburg"},"name":"Martijn Verburg"}],"title":"Annual Java User Group Network Fest","lang":"en","summary":"This BOF is a great excuse to meet face 2 face with all the other User Group leaders and enjoy a few beers afterwards  :)"},"fromTime":"20:00","toTimeMillis":1415908800000,"toTime":"21:00","roomCapacity":70,"roomName":"BOF 1","slotId":"bof_bof1_thursday_13_20h0_21h0","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"bof2","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1415905200000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"classroom","talk":{"talkType":"BOF (Bird of a Feather)","track":"Web & HTML5","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Web Components will fundamentally change how developers build web experiences.
