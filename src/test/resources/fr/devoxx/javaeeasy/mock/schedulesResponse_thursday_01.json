Many people know that OpenJDK is the open source reference implementation for the JDK, but how many of us take the time to explore the inner-workings of the platform that we build our applications upon? We believe that every developer can learn something by doing so.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to explore the source code and perhaps see how lambdas have been implemented in JDK 8, or hack on the JDK itself and learn how to make that modification to HashMap that you’ve always dreamed of, or even learn how you can help to make it easier for fellow developers to contribute code to upstream Oracle repos, then we’ve got you covered. Come and join us for an evening of OpenJDK exploration, and learn how you can explore and contribute to the future of Java in a very practical fashion."
